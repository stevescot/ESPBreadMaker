## Root Cause Analysis

### Temperature Sensor Failure
The most critical issue is that the temperature sensor is reading exactly 0.0°C, which indicates:

1. **Hardware Failure:** RTD sensor disconnected or damaged
2. **Calibration Issue:** Sensor calibration data corrupted
3. **ADC Problem:** ESP32 analog input malfunction
4. **Software Bug:** Temperature reading function fault

### PID Control Danger
With 0°C input and 25°C setpoint, the PID controller sees a massive error and drives output to 100%. This could:
- Overheat the system
- Damage heating elements
- Create safety hazards
- Waste energy

## Immediate Actions Required

### 🚨 **URGENT - SAFETY FIRST**
1. **STOP THE PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY**
2. **Disable heater manually**
3. **Check physical RTD sensor connections**
4. **Verify sensor calibration data**

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting Steps**
1. Check RTD sensor wiring to ESP32 analog pin
2. Test sensor resistance with multimeter
3. Reload calibration data from backup
4. Check for loose connections in breadmaker housing
5. Verify ADC functionality with known test values

### 📊 **Performance Optimization**
1. **Network Latency:** Check WiFi signal strength and router distance
2. **Response Times:** Consider caching frequently accessed data
3. **Memory Usage:** Monitor for memory leaks during long operations

## Performance Metrics History
- **Build Date:** Jul 20 2025 (Recent firmware)
- **Uptime:** 10+ hours (Good stability)
- **Memory Stability:** Consistent ~160KB free heap
- **Network Stability:** Connected but slow response times

## Recommendations

### Critical (Immediate)
- [ ] **EMERGENCY STOP** - Disable heater until sensor fixed
- [ ] Replace or reconnect RTD temperature sensor
- [ ] Test system with known temperature source
- [ ] Implement temperature sensor fault detection in firmware

### Performance (Short-term)
- [ ] Investigate WiFi latency issues
- [ ] Add sensor validation in temperature reading function
- [ ] Implement automatic heater shutdown on sensor fault
- [ ] Add watchdog timer for temperature readings

### Long-term
- [ ] Add redundant temperature sensing
- [ ] Implement hardware safety shutoffs
- [ ] Add comprehensive system health monitoring
- [ ] Create automated fault detection and recovery

## Conclusion

**The ESP32 breadmaker controller has a CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUE** due to temperature sensor failure. The system is currently operating dangerously with the heater at 100% output while receiving no temperature feedback. 

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Stop operation and fix temperature sensor before continuing any breadmaking operations.

Performance-wise, the system shows good stability and memory management, but network latency is higher than optimal for local operations.
