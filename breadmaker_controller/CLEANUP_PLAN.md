- `upload_programs.bat` ✅ REMOVED → Use `.\unified_build.ps1 -UploadData`
- `manual_upload.bat` ✅ REMOVED

### ✅ PowerShell Scripts (.ps1) in Root - REMOVED
- `upload_files_robust.ps1` ✅ REMOVED → Use `.\unified_build.ps1 -UploadData`
- `upload_files_robust_deprecated.ps1` ✅ REMOVED
- `upload.ps1` ✅ REMOVED → Use `.\unified_build.ps1 -WebOTA`
- `quick_upload.ps1` ✅ REMOVED → Use `.\unified_build.ps1 -WebOTA`

- `archive/upload_files*.ps1` ✅ REMOVED
- `archive/old_upload_scripts/` (entire folder) ✅ REMOVED

### ✅ Legacy Display Library Files - REMOVED
- `TFT_eSPI_Setup.h` ✅ REMOVED → No longer used (project uses LovyanGFX, not TFT_eSPI)

## Files to Keep

### Core Build Scripts
- `build_esp32.ps1` - Core compilation script (used by unified_build.ps1)
- `unified_build.ps1` - **NEW: Main build/upload tool**
- `reset_and_monitor.ps1` - Serial monitoring utility
- `setup_esp32_core.ps1` - Development environment setup

### Data Management
- `create_fatfs.py` - Filesystem creation utility
- `split_programs.py` - Program file management

### Documentation
- `copilot_instructions.md` - **UPDATED: Build procedures**
- `BUILD_README.md`
- `OTA_README.md`
- Various `*.md` files for documentation

## Migration Commands

~~The cleanup has been completed. The following commands were executed:~~

```powershell
# ✅ COMPLETED: Remove superseded batch files
Remove-Item upload_programs.bat
Remove-Item manual_upload.bat

# ✅ COMPLETED: Remove superseded PowerShell scripts
Remove-Item upload_files_robust.ps1, upload_files_robust_deprecated.ps1
Remove-Item upload.ps1, quick_upload.ps1

# ✅ COMPLETED: Remove legacy display library file

# ✅ COMPLETED: Remove archive folder (contains only legacy scripts)
Remove-Item archive -Recurse -Force

# ✅ VERIFIED: New unified script works
.\unified_build.ps1 -Test
```

## New Workflow Summary

### For Copilot/Future Development:
1. **Build only**: `.\unified_build.ps1 -Build`
2. **Build + Upload**: `.\unified_build.ps1 -Build -WebOTA`
3. **Upload data files**: `.\unified_build.ps1 -UploadData`
4. **Full deployment**: `.\unified_build.ps1 -Build -WebOTA -UploadData`
5. **Test connectivity**: `.\unified_build.ps1 -Test`

### Replaced Commands:
- Old: `upload_programs.bat` → New: `.\unified_build.ps1 -UploadData`
- Old: `build_and_upload_ota.ps1` → New: `.\unified_build.ps1 -Build -WebOTA`
- Old: Multiple upload scripts → New: Single `.\unified_build.ps1` with parameters

This consolidation provides:
- ✅ Single script for all operations
- ✅ Consistent error handling and output
- ✅ Built-in connectivity testing
- ✅ Clear parameter-based operation selection
- ✅ Comprehensive help documentation
- ✅ Future-proof extensibility
