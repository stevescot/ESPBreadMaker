# OTA Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Integrated OTA Upload into build_esp32.ps1
- **Removed dependency** on separate `upload_ota.ps1` script
- **Added full OTA functionality** directly into the main build script
- **Fixed binary path issue** - now correctly looks for `build\breadmaker_controller.ino.bin`

### 2. Build Script Improvements
- **Added `--build-path "./build"`** to arduino-cli compile command for consistent output location
- **Integrated connectivity testing** before attempting OTA upload
- **Added proper error handling** with detailed error messages and logs
- **Improved user feedback** with clear status messages and color coding

### 3. Files Removed
- **`upload_ota.ps1`** - No longer needed, functionality moved to build_esp32.ps1

## How to Use

### OTA Upload Commands
```powershell
# Compile and upload via OTA (no password)
.\build_esp32.ps1 -OTA 192.168.250.125

# Compile and upload via OTA with password
.\build_esp32.ps1 -OTA 192.168.250.125 -OTAPassword mypass

# Compile and upload via OTA with data files
.\build_esp32.ps1 -OTA 192.168.250.125 -UploadData
```

### Serial Upload Commands (unchanged)
```powershell
# Compile and upload via serial port
.\build_esp32.ps1 -Port COM3

# Compile and upload via serial with data files
.\build_esp32.ps1 -Port COM3 -UploadData
```

## Technical Details

### Binary Location
- **Build output**: `build\breadmaker_controller.ino.bin`
- **Size**: ~1.13MB (1,134,800 bytes)
- **Build path**: Explicitly set to `./build` for consistency

### OTA Process
1. **Compilation** with fixed build path
2. **Binary verification** - checks if `.bin` file exists
3. **ESP32 tool detection** - finds `espota.py` in Arduino installation
4. **Connectivity test** - verifies device is reachable on port 3232
5. **Upload execution** - uses Python with espota.py
6. **Error handling** - captures and displays any errors
7. **Cleanup** - removes temporary log files

### Error Handling
- **Binary not found**: Clear error message with build path
- **espota.py missing**: Guides user to install ESP32 Arduino Core
- **Device unreachable**: Lists troubleshooting steps
- **Upload failure**: Shows detailed error logs

## Testing Results

✅ **Compilation**: Works correctly with consistent build path  
✅ **Binary Detection**: Correctly finds `build\breadmaker_controller.ino.bin`  
✅ **Tool Detection**: Successfully locates espota.py  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper connectivity testing and error messages  
✅ **Integration**: Single script handles both compile and OTA upload  

⚠️ **Device Testing**: Cannot test actual upload without device connected to WiFi

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Workflow**: Single command for compile + OTA upload
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear guidance when things go wrong
3. **Consistent Paths**: Fixed binary location issue
4. **Integrated Testing**: Connectivity check before upload attempt
5. **Maintainability**: One script to maintain instead of two

## Previous Issue Resolved

**Before**: 
```
Error: Compiled binary not found at build\esp32.esp32.esp32\breadmaker_controller.ino.bin
```

**After**: 
```
Binary found: build\breadmaker_controller.ino.bin
File size: 1134800 bytes
```

The issue was that `upload_ota.ps1` was looking for the binary in the default arduino-cli temporary build location, while the build script needed to specify a consistent build path.
