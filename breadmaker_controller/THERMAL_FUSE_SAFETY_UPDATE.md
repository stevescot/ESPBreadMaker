# Thermal Fuse Safety Update - Programs.json

## Safety Issue Identified
The breadmaker has a 180°C thermal fuse for safety protection. Several programs had baking temperatures that exceeded this limit, which could potentially trigger the thermal fuse and disable the breadmaker.

## Dangerous Temperatures Found and Fixed

### 1. Bread - Sourdough In-Machine (Program ID: 1)
- **Bake 1**: 230°C → 175°C (reduced by 55°C)
- **Bake 2**: 230°C → 175°C (reduced by 55°C)
- **Timing Adjustment**: Extended baking times to compensate
  - Bake 1: 20 min → 30 min (+10 min)
  - Bake 2: 25 min → 35 min (+10 min)

### 2. Bread - White Basic (Program ID: 3)
- **Bake**: 190°C → 175°C (reduced by 15°C)
- **Timing Adjustment**: 40 min → 50 min (+10 min)

### 3. Bread - Whole Wheat (Program ID: 4)
- **Bake**: 180°C → 175°C (reduced by 5°C)
- **Timing Adjustment**: 45 min → 55 min (+10 min)

### 4. Bread - Rye (Program ID: 6)
- **Bake**: 185°C → 175°C (reduced by 10°C)
- **Timing Adjustment**: 50 min → 60 min (+10 min)

## Safety Validation
✅ **Maximum Temperature**: Now 175°C (5°C safety margin below thermal fuse)
✅ **All Programs Checked**: No temperatures exceed 180°C limit
✅ **Timing Compensated**: Extended baking times to maintain bread quality

## Baking Science Rationale
- Lower temperature with longer time produces better crust development
- 175°C is still sufficient for proper bread baking and Maillard reactions
- Extended times compensate for reduced temperature
- Maintains food safety and bread quality while protecting hardware

✅ **Status Confirmed**: Controller responded with {"status":"uploaded"}

## Safety Margin
- **Thermal Fuse Limit**: 180°C
- **New Maximum Temperature**: 175°C
- **Safety Margin**: 5°C buffer to prevent accidental triggering

## Next Steps
1. Test bread programs to ensure quality is maintained
2. Monitor temperature accuracy during baking
3. Document any further adjustments needed

**Date**: August 15, 2025
**Status**: Complete - All programs now thermal fuse safe
