# ESP32 Breadmaker StreamStatusJson Implementation & Upload System

This document summarizes the comprehensive streaming JSON implementation and upload system improvements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced StreamStatusJson Implementation (missing_stubs.cpp)

**Problem Solved:** The original `streamStatusJson` function was very basic and the frontend was not receiving all the data needed for the stages table display.

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive streaming JSON function that:
- **Streams directly to Print interface** without creating large strings in memory
- **Includes all data needed by frontend** for complete functionality
- **Uses printf-style formatting** for efficient streaming
- **Provides comprehensive program and stage information**

**Key Data Included:**
- Core state (running, temperature, setpoint)
- Complete program information (name, ID, stages)
- Detailed stage information (current stage, time left, ready times)
- Output states (heater, motor, light, buzzer)
- Manual mode status
- Mix pattern information
- Program completion predictions
- Fermentation data
- WiFi connection details
- System health metrics
- PID parameters
- Startup delay status

### 2. Updated Web Endpoints (web_endpoints_new.cpp)

**Problem Solved:** Endpoints were using string concatenation which wastes memory.

**Changes:**
- **Updated `/status` endpoint** to use direct streaming with `server.setContentLength(CONTENT_LENGTH_UNKNOWN)`
- **Added missing `/api/status` endpoint** for frontend compatibility  
- **Added `/api/ota/upload` endpoint** for OTA firmware updates
- **Marked `getStatusJsonString()` as deprecated** but kept for backward compatibility
- **Enhanced OTA support** with dedicated upload endpoint

### 3. Comprehensive Upload Scripts

**Problem Solved:** Upload scripts were scattered and didn't handle both file uploads and OTA firmware updates.

**New Scripts Created:**

#### `upload_all.ps1` - Complete Upload Solution
- **Handles both file uploads and OTA firmware updates**
- **Auto-detection** of what to upload based on available files
- **Build integration** - can build firmware first, then upload
- **Robust retry logic** with configurable delays and retry counts
- **Progress tracking** and detailed error reporting
- **Supports directory structure preservation**
- **Uses `/api/upload` endpoint** for file uploads
- **Uses `/api/ota/upload` endpoint** for firmware OTA updates

#### `quick_upload.ps1` - Simplified Interface
- **Easy-to-use wrapper** around the comprehensive script
- **Simple command line options** (-firmware, -both, -build, -ip)
- **Default behaviors** for common use cases

#### `test_endpoints.ps1` - Validation Tool
- **Tests all JSON endpoints** for proper streaming functionality
- **Validates JSON format** and content
- **Tests file upload functionality** with actual file transfer
- **Tests OTA endpoint availability**
- **Provides detailed diagnostics**

### 4. Memory Efficiency Improvements

**Streaming Architecture:**
- **No large string allocation** - data streams directly to client
- **Memory-efficient JSON generation** using printf-style formatting
- **Chunked response handling** for large data sets
- **Reduced memory pressure** on ESP32

### 5. External Function Declarations

**Added missing declarations** to ensure all functions are available:
- `getActiveProgramMutable()`
- `isProgramValid()`
- `ensureProgramLoaded()`
- `switchToProfile()`
- `saveSettings()`
- Build date constant definition

## Usage Examples

### Upload Files Only (Default)
```powershell
.\quick_upload.ps1
# or
.\upload_all.ps1 -UploadFiles
```

### Upload Firmware Only
```powershell
.\quick_upload.ps1 -firmware
# or  
.\upload_all.ps1 -UploadFirmware -FirmwareFile "firmware.bin"
```

### Build and Upload Firmware
```powershell
.\quick_upload.ps1 -build
# or
.\upload_all.ps1 -BuildFirst -UploadFirmware
```

### Upload Both Files and Firmware
```powershell
.\quick_upload.ps1 -both
# or
.\upload_all.ps1 -UploadFiles -UploadFirmware
```

### Test Endpoints
```powershell
.\test_endpoints.ps1 -Verbose
```

## API Endpoints

### Status Endpoints (Enhanced with Streaming)
- **`/status`** - Legacy status endpoint (now streams)
- **`/api/status`** - API status endpoint (streams)
- **`/api/firmware_info`** - Firmware information

### Upload Endpoints  
- **`/api/upload`** - File upload via multipart form data
- **`/upload`** - Alternative file upload endpoint

### OTA Endpoints
- **`/api/ota/upload`** - Firmware upload for OTA updates
- **`/api/update`** - Alternative firmware upload endpoint
- **`/api/ota/status`** - OTA operation status
- **`/api/ota`** - OTA availability check

## Frontend Compatibility

The enhanced `streamStatusJson` function now provides all data needed by the frontend:

**For Program Stages Table:**
- `program` - Current program name
- `programId` - Current program ID  
- `stage` - Current stage name
- `stageIdx` - Current stage index
- `stage_time_left` - Time remaining in current stage
- `stage_ready_at` - When current stage will be complete
- `program_ready_at` - When entire program will be complete

**For Status Display:**
- `running` - Whether breadmaker is active
- `temperature` - Current temperature
- `setpoint` - Target temperature
- `heater`, `motor`, `light`, `buzzer` - Output states

**For Advanced Features:**  
- `fermentationFactor` - Q10 fermentation adjustment
- `actualStageStartTimes` - Array of when each stage started
- `manualMode` - Manual control mode status
- `wifi` - Network connection details

## Memory Usage

**Before:** String concatenation created 2KB+ strings in memory
**After:** Direct streaming with no large string allocation

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced heap fragmentation**
- **Lower memory pressure**  
- **Better ESP32 stability**
- **Faster response times**

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify functionality:

```powershell
.\test_endpoints.ps1 -Verbose
```

This tests:
1. **Connectivity** to ESP32
2. **JSON endpoint** functionality and format validation
3. **File upload** capability with actual file transfer
4. **OTA endpoint** availability

## Future Improvements

1. **Compression** - Could add gzip compression for even smaller responses
2. **Caching** - Could add smarter caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Websockets** - Could add websocket streaming for real-time updates
4. **Authentication** - Could add basic authentication for secure uploads

## Troubleshooting

### JSON Streaming Issues
- Check that `streamStatusJson()` is being called correctly
- Verify `CONTENT_LENGTH_UNKNOWN` is set for streaming responses
- Ensure all external functions are properly declared

### Upload Issues  
- Verify `/api/upload` endpoint exists and is properly configured
- Check that multipart form data is formatted correctly
- Ensure ESP32 has sufficient free space for uploads

### OTA Issues
- Check that `/api/ota/upload` endpoint is available
- Verify firmware file is valid binary format
- Ensure ESP32 has sufficient space for firmware update

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
