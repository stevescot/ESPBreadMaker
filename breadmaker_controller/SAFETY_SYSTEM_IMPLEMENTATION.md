# Safety System Implementation - ESP32 Breadmaker Controller

## Overview
A comprehensive safety monitoring system has been implemented to address the critical temperature sensor fault discovered on device 192.168.250.125, where temperature readings were stuck at 0.0°C while the heater was running at 100% output.

## Safety Features Implemented

### 1. Temperature Sensor Validation
- **Zero Temperature Detection**: Triggers emergency shutdown after 3 consecutive zero readings
- **Invalid Temperature Range**: Monitors readings outside -10°C to 250°C range  
- **Sensor Timeout**: Emergency shutdown if no valid temperature readings for 10 seconds
- **Consecutive Fault Tracking**: Counts invalid readings and triggers shutdown after 5 consecutive faults

### 2. Emergency Temperature Limits (Oven-Appropriate)
- **Maximum Safe Temperature**: 235°C (normal oven operation limit)
- **Emergency Shutdown Threshold**: 240°C (immediate shutdown, no delay)
- **Temperature Range Validation**: -10°C to 250°C for sensor sanity checking

### 3. Heating Effectiveness Monitoring
- **Temperature Rise Validation**: Ensures at least 2°C rise within 30 seconds of heating
- **Heating Timeout**: Emergency shutdown if heater runs 5 minutes without temperature rise
- **Heating Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitors if heating system is working properly

### 4. PID Saturation Monitoring
- **Normal Saturation Detection**: Tracks when PID output ≥95% (normal during heat-up)
- **Extended Saturation Warning**: Logs warning if saturated >10 minutes (diagnostic only)
- **Saturation Duration Tracking**: Monitors how long PID remains saturated

### 5. Loop Performance Monitoring
- **Loop Timing Analysis**: Tracks minimum, maximum, and average loop execution times
- **Critical Loop Time Detection**: Warns if loop takes >1 second (performance issue)
- **Performance Metrics**: Available via `/api/status` endpoint for monitoring

## Low-Impact Implementation

### Timing Optimization
- **Safety Checks**: Run only every 1 second to minimize loop overhead
- **Performance Tracking**: Uses microsecond precision for accurate measurement
- **Conditional Execution**: Skips checks when in emergency shutdown state

### Memory Efficiency
- **Static Constants**: All thresholds defined as `constexpr` for compile-time optimization
- **Minimal State**: Only essential safety state tracked in global structure
- **Efficient JSON Output**: Safety status added to existing `/api/status` endpoint

## Emergency Shutdown Behavior

### Immediate Actions
1. **Output Shutdown**: All outputs (heater, motor, light) immediately disabled
2. **Buzzer Activation**: Sounds alarm to alert user of emergency condition
3. **Program Termination**: Any running program is immediately stopped
4. **PID Reset**: Temperature setpoint reset to 0, output forced to 0
5. **Display Update**: Shows shutdown reason on TFT display

### Shutdown Reasons
- `"Emergency: Temperature exceeds 240°C"`
- `"Shutdown: Temperature sensor fault detected"`
- `"Shutdown: Temperature sensor timeout"`
- `"Shutdown: Temperature exceeds 235°C limit"`
- `"Shutdown: Heater ineffective (5min no rise)"`

## Web Interface Integration

### Safety Status Endpoint
The `/api/status` endpoint now includes comprehensive safety information:

```json
{
  // ... existing status fields ...
  "safety": {
    "emergencyShutdown": false,
    "shutdownReason": "",
    "shutdownTime": 0,
    "temperatureValid": true,
    "heatingEffective": true,
    "pidSaturated": false,
    "invalidTempCount": 0,
    "zeroTempCount": 0,
    "avgLoopTimeUs": 1250,
    "maxLoopTimeUs": 2100,
    "maxSafeTemp": 235.0,
    "emergencyTemp": 240.0
  },
  "status": "ok"  // Changes to "emergency_shutdown" during fault
}
```

### Display Integration
- **Emergency Display**: Uses existing `displayError()` function to show shutdown reason
- **Status Updates**: TFT display immediately shows emergency shutdown information
- **Visual Alert**: Clear indication when safety system has triggered

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- **`globals.h`**: Added `SafetySystem` struct with all monitoring capabilities
- **`globals.cpp`**: Added `safetySystem` global instance
- **`breadmaker_controller.ino`**: Added safety functions and loop integration

### Safety Functions Added
- **`performSafetyChecks()`**: Main safety monitoring function (low-impact, 1Hz)
- **`triggerEmergencyShutdown()`**: Emergency shutdown with display notification
- **Safety initialization**: Called during setup() for proper system initialization

### Web API Enhancement
- **`missing_stubs.cpp`**: Enhanced `streamStatusJson()` with safety status information
- **Real-time monitoring**: Safety status available for external monitoring systems

## Critical Issue Addressed

The implementation directly addresses the discovered fault on device 192.168.250.125:
- **Temperature sensor returning 0.0°C readings**
- **Heater running at 100% without temperature feedback**
- **No safety mechanism to detect and prevent this dangerous condition**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Temperature Sensor Disconnect**: Verify emergency shutdown when sensor disconnected
2. **Invalid Temperature Simulation**: Test with readings outside valid range
3. **Heating Effectiveness**: Test with heater disabled to verify effectiveness monitoring
4. **Emergency Temperature**: Test behavior near 235°C and 240°C thresholds
5. **Performance Impact**: Monitor loop timing to ensure <50ms average execution
6. **Web Interface**: Verify safety status appears correctly in `/api/status`

## Usage Notes

### Normal Operation
- Safety system runs transparently with minimal performance impact
- PID saturation during heat-up is expected and normal
- Loop performance metrics help identify system stress

### Emergency Conditions
- System enters fail-safe mode with all heating disabled
- Manual intervention required to restart after emergency shutdown
- Shutdown reason displayed on both TFT and web interface

### Monitoring
- External systems can monitor safety status via `/api/status` endpoint
- Performance metrics help identify potential issues before they become critical
- Safety event logging provides audit trail for maintenance

This implementation provides comprehensive protection against the type of critical failure discovered, while maintaining the low-impact operation required for stable breadmaker control.
