# Documentation Consolidation

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All individual documentation files have been consolidated into `CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

## Consolidated Documentation Files:
- ASYNC_WEBSERVER_ISSUE.md → Section: System Architecture
- BUILD_README.md → Section: Build and Deployment  
- ENDPOINT_*.md → Section: Web Endpoints
- ESP32_MIGRATION_*.md → Section: Migration History
- EWMA_STUCK_STATE_RECOVERY.md → Section: Temperature Control System
- FILE_UPLOAD_*.md → Section: OTA Updates
- MAIN_PAGE_DISPLAY_FIX.md → Section: Development Guidelines
- MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION_*.md → Section: Memory Optimization
- OTA_*.md → Section: OTA Updates
- PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md → Section: Performance Analysis
- PROGRAM_*.md → Section: System Architecture
- RANGE_MANAGEMENT_SUMMARY.md → Section: Development Guidelines
- SAFETY_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md → Section: Safety Systems
- SCREENSAVER_IMPLEMENTATION.md → Section: System Architecture
- STRING_TO_SPRINTF_OPTIMIZATION.md → Section: Memory Optimization
- TEMPERATURE_DATA_SOURCES.md → Section: Temperature Control System
- THERMAL_FUSE_SAFETY_UPDATE.md → Section: Safety Systems
- ULTRA_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md → Section: Memory Optimization
- WEBSERVER_MIGRATION_STATUS.md → Section: Migration History

## Future Documentation Policy:
**ALL new documentation must be added to `CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md` in the appropriate section.**

No new standalone .md files should be created unless they serve a specific build/deployment purpose (like README.md or copilot_instructions.md).

## Cleanup Recommendation:
The individual .md files can now be safely archived or removed since all information has been consolidated into the comprehensive `CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.
